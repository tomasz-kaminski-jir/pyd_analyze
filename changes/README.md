# Pending Changes

This directory contains files describing changes to pydantic since the last release.

If you're creating a pull request, please add a new file to this directory called
`<pull request or issue id>.rst`. It should be formatted as a single paragraph of
[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).

The paragraph should end with the pull request or issue ID and your github username
eg. `fix foobar broken thing, #123 by @samuelcolvin`.

The contents of this fill will be used to update `HISTORY.rst` before the next release.
